              <h2> Welcome to my website! </h2>
<p> 
My name is Gabriel Ferreira Silva and here you will find both the papers we have
published and the slides we have used for presentations.  I am a computer science PhD
student at <a href="https://international.unb.br/">University of Brasília</a>,
Brazil. My advisor is <a href="https://www.mat.unb.br/ayala/">Mauricio Ayala-Rincón</a> and my co-advisor is  
<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/maribel-fernandez">Maribel Fernández</a>.  
We work with <a href="https://www.mat.unb.br/dnantes/">Daniele Nantes</a> and <a href="https://www3.risc.jku.at/people/tkutsia/">Temur Kutsia</a>.
I recently also started working as a data analyst for the Brazilian government at
<a href="https://www.tjdft.jus.br/">TJDFT</a>. 

<br> <br> PS: I stand with Ukraine! </br> </br> </p>

<h1> Current Work </h1>
I am currently working on an extended version of our paper "A Certified Algorithm for AC-Unification", as I believe
there were interesting questions we did not explore due to the page limit. I am also writing my PhD thesis, my PhD Viva
    presentation will be on 26/01/2024.
