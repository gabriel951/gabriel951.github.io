<h1> Welcome to my website! </h1>
<p> 
My name is Gabriel Ferreira Silva Tibúrcio and here you will find both the papers we have
published and the slides we have used for presentations.  I finished my PhD in theoretical computer science 
at <a href="https://international.unb.br/">University of Brasília</a>,
Brazil. My advisor was <a href="https://www.mat.unb.br/ayala/">Mauricio Ayala-Rincón</a> and my co-advisor was
<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/maribel-fernandez">Maribel Fernández</a>.  
We worked with <a href="https://www.mat.unb.br/dnantes/">Daniele Nantes</a> and <a href="https://www3.risc.jku.at/people/tkutsia/">Temur Kutsia</a>.
I recently started working as a data analyst for the Brazilian government at
<a href="https://www.tjdft.jus.br/">TJDFT</a> and I am not doing much academic work nowadays. 

<br> <br> PS: I stand with Ukraine! </br>
PS 2: I added the surname "Tibúrcio" to my name only in January 2025, so you might see my full name written as "Gabriel Ferreira Silva" in 
some old publications. </br> </br>

<h1> Current Work </h1>
Although I am working for the Brazilian government in a non-academic area at the moment, we
submitted an  extended version of our paper "A Certified Algorithm for
AC-Unification", as I believe there were interesting questions we did not
explore due to the page limit.
